# One Page Dungeon Navigator

This project lets you navigate a procedurally generated [One Page Dungeon](https://watabou.github.io/dungeon.html)

Seeing that the developer Oleg Dolya released a JSON exporter for these dungeons, I thought it'd be fun to actually navigate around them.

## Development

### Webpage

* `npm run build`
* `npm run serve`

### Node app

* `npm run build:node`
* `npm run run:node` or `node ./script/node.js`
