# Dungeon Explorer

Dungeon Explorer is an old-school hack-n-slash dungeon-crawler mini-game that you play in your browser. Explore sprawling dungeons, collect loot, and battle monsters. Addictive, quick and random.

This project is based on the popular [One Page Dungeon](https://watabou.github.io/dungeon.html). One Page Dungeon procedurally generates static maps that you can use in your own projects.

The Dungeon Explorer project converts One Page Dungeon static, graphic maps into mini-games that you can play.
