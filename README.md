# One Page Dungeon Navigator

This project lets you navigate a procedurally generated [One Page Dungeon](https://watabou.github.io/dungeon.html)

Seeing that the developer Oleg Dolya released a JSON exporter for these dungeons, I thought it'd be fun to actually navigate around them.

Give it a try! [one-map.netlify.app](https://one-map.netlify.app/)
