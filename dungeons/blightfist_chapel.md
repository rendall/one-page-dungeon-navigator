# Blightfist Chapel

_For many years the chapel was considered lost. Recently a terryfying man-eating wasp has made its home here. It is said that Ekethteri, a legendary compass, is hidden here._

1. A magic tome at the bottom of a pool.
2. A mouth-shaped double door on the western wall of the small chamber.
3. A crystalized body of a gnoll, an enchanted sword and a rope nearby.
4. An old friend. Would like to hire you for a job.
