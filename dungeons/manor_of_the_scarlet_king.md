# Manor of the Scarlet King

_For decades the manor of the Scarlet King was considered lost. These days it is overrun with worms. The manor of the Scarlet King is a place of growth of a rare specie of mushrooms._

1. A rear entrance into the manor. A large ironbound double door with a keyhole on the southern wall of the small chamber.
2. A dying knight, a key among his belongings.
3. A mosaic, totally destroyed by mold.
4. A broken strongbox with a bronze chess piece in it.
5. Lockpicks and some gold tucked under some debris.
6. A quiet bard, resting in a corner.
7. An uncanny, unnaturally heavy statuette in the middle of a circle of runes on the ground.
