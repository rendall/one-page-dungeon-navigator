# Pyramid of the White Dragon 

*For years the pyramid of the White Dragon remained sealed. Currently it is badly infested by pigeons.*

1. A mosaic of a star pattern on the ceiling
2. A battered double door with two keyholes to the west.
3. A lifelike statue of a dwarf, a key in its hands.
4. A weird, glowing box among rubble on the ground.
5. An impossible puzzle, answers one question when solved.
6. A battered sarcophagus containing a key.
