# Abbey of the Blood Lady

_The Blood Lady is long dead, but people are still afraid to come close to the abbey. Recently a giant invisible goat has made its home here. Word is that countless treasures of ancient books and maps and charts are stored here._

1. A huge door to the south.
2. A rapier tucked under some debris.
3. A sign on the floor: WHERE IN HELL IS MY MANTLE
4. A strange, ice-cold to touch hammer in a curio case.
5. A corpse of a human, a golden chain close to it.
6. A blood-covered altar, blinds a person when the candles on it are lit.
7. A medium locker with some gold, a scarf and lockpicks in it.
