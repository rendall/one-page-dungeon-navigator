# Dreadring Maze

_For centuries the maze was considered lost. Now it is controlled by a party of gnolls. Word is that the maze is rich with ancient books and magical artifacts._

1. A battered double door with a keyhole on the northern wall.
2. An ivy-covered body of a gnoll, a torch, a mantle and a rusty halberd nearby.
3. A chest containing a key.
4. A child, resting in a corner.
