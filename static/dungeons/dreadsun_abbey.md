# Dreadsun Abbey

_For a long time the abbey remained sealed. Recently a fearsome spectral sparrow has made its home here. The abbey is home to a valuable specie of herbs._

1. A large wooden gate to the west.
2. A large locker containing a weird, warm to touch dagger.
3. Remains of a pirate apparently killed by pirates, a scarf in his hands.
4. A crowbar and some gold hidden in a crevice of the floor.
5. A girl, sitting on the ground.
6. A rear entrance into the abbey. A lifelike sculpture of a dwarf shaman, a staff of frost in its hands.
7. A carving on the wall, totally destroyed by mold.
8. A stuffed shark, heals a person when stroked.
9. An enigmatic monk. Claims to have a message for you.
