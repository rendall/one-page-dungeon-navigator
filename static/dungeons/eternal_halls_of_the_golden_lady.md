# Eternal Halls of the Golden Lady

_The Golden Lady is long dead, but people are still afraid to come close to the halls. Recently a terryfying man-eating lizard has made its home here._

1. A huge iron gate with a keyhole to the east.
2. A relief on the wall, totally destroyed by goblin vandals.
3. An iron key hidden in a crevice of the wall.
