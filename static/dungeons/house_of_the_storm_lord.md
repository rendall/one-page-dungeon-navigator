# House of the Storm Lord 

*For decades the house of the Storm Lord was considered lost. Recently a fearsome intelligent goat has made its lair here.*

1. A strange, made of an unknown material long sword tucked under some debris.
2. A large door with a keyhole to the west.
3. A graffiti on the wall, totally destroyed by fire.
4. A battered locker holds a skull-shaped key.
