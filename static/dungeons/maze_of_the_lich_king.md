# Maze of the Lich King

_The maze of the Lich King is situated at a bend of the river Ragewing. These days it is badly infested by crows._

1. A lavishly decorated wooden door with a keyhole to the east.
2. An enchanted book in a trophy case.
3. A pile of rubble hides a mysterious, covered with runes object.
4. A strongbox holds lockpicks and some gold.
5. Remains of a goblin apparently killed by rabbits, a key clutched in his hands.
