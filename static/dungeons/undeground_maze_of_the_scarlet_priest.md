# Undeground Maze of the Scarlet Priest

_For centuries the maze of the Scarlet Priest remained uninhabited. Recently an undead man-eating crow has made its lair here._

1. A mosaic of an eye pattern on the ceiling
2. A large pile of rubble hides a niddle of magic missile.
3. A bandit, resting on the ground.
4. A notable iron gate on the western wall.
5. A potion of mind reading and a regular spear in a medium locker.
6. A corpse of a bandit, a leather armor close to it.
