# Vault of the Obsidian Titan

_For a millenium the vault of the Obsidian Titan remained sealed. Currently it is infested by lions. It is said that the vault is rich with gold and ancient books._

2. A lavishly decorated door with a keyhole to the north.
3. Some gold and arrows at the bottom of a small pool.
4. A brass key hovering in the middle of the chamber.
