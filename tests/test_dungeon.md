# Test Dungeon

_For several centuries the house of Iados remained sealed. These days it is badly infested by goats._

1. A mouth-shaped stone double door with a keyhole to the west.
2. A scale mail tucked under some debris.
3. A claw-shaped key hidden in a crack of the wall.

Test Dungeon is based on "House of Iados"
